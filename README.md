# Tiberio-s-Guide-to-Monsters-In-Avernus

This is a book written by Tiberio, a Paladin Warlock Hexblade character created by me for the adventure baldur's gate descent into avernus.


On the spare time, during his short and long rests Tiberio draw a drawing of the monsters that him and his friends saw in avernus.
