## Character Background

Tiberius is a Baldur's gate nobleman from a Warlock family.

Your family has a sword that is passed down from generation to generation.

At one point in his life his parents were killed by a demonic entity.

Tiberius took the sword "Shadowmourne" and his soul was corrupted by him and felt an entity in him.

Tiberius went to candlekeep to seek knowledge and understand more about fiends.

In candlekeep he met an archeologist named Sylvira Savikas who taught him several things about the 7 hells.

He then sought knowledge in the large candlekeep library and became a paladin.

Tiberio was once sent to hell by Sylvira and knows a little of it.

Now he is on candlekeep studying more about spells.

Two-faced coin (hoar symbol) that he carries, the two sides are like that.

He uses it to deceive others by playing heads or tails and always falls heads.
